#pytc
<i>pytc</i> (stands for Python Test Case) is a tiny Python code testing tool designed to keep your Python test cases organized and informative.

#What's in the Box?
You basically get two main classes (`TestCase` and `ColorfulOutputLogger`). `TestCase` is the class you'll need to extend in every test case class you write, and `ColorfulOutputLogger` is a debugging mechanism used to log all outputs in a proper format.
